📌 Conclusion
This exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the retail sales dataset provided several valuable insights into product performance, customer behavior, and temporal sales trends. Here are the key takeaways:

🛍️ Product and Category Insights
Jeans, Wall Art, and Headphones emerged as the top-selling products by quantity, indicating strong and consistent demand.

In terms of revenue, electronics and sports products contributed significantly, showing that high-value items, though fewer in quantity, drive substantial income.

The Groceries category showed frequent purchases with moderate sales per transaction, reflecting regular customer needs.

👥 Customer Behavior
The business has a solid customer base with 100 unique customers, some of whom made multiple purchases.

A small group of customers (top 10) contributed to a large portion of the revenue, highlighting potential for customer loyalty programs.

Purchase patterns suggest a need for customer segmentation and personalized offers.

📅 Time-Based Trends
Sales showed clear seasonal variation, with higher sales in certain months, indicating marketing campaigns or festivals might be boosting sales.

Weekday analysis revealed that sales are relatively consistent, but a few specific days perform better — possibly due to paydays or weekend shopping.

Year-over-year trends suggest business growth, providing optimism for future performance if current strategies are maintained or improved.

📈 Overall Performance
The dataset reflects a healthy balance of frequently bought essentials (like groceries) and high-ticket items (like electronics).

With strong product performance and repeat customers, the business has a good opportunity to scale through data-driven decision-making, targeted marketing, and stock optimization.
